# unify 

### an image processing application
- Project Foundation: basic image processing environment (upload, analyze, save user-chosen images)
- Project Goal: expand by adding features as I learn more about topics in image processing
### overview
I am interested in exploring topics relating to image processing and wanted a 'playground' where I could mess around with different ideas for image analysis techniques. 
I love to try and come up with new ways to make images do weird things with code, so my hope is that having a fully custom application will easily allow me to explore
new and fun ideas! Not really sure where this project will go, but I would like to make it open-source so others can make suggestions and have fun with it too!
### brief aside
I've never developed a software 'product' from the ground up before, so I hope to gain experience in areas such as program security (user data/other stuff I don't understand yet), 
UX/UI design, database stuff, logo/'marketing' stuff, and who knows what else!
